# Gardening Buddy

## 📝 Project Summary
**Gardening Buddy** is an all-in-one AI-powered application designed to empower aspiring home gardeners. It features a curated Plant Selector, real-time AI Plant Identification via camera integration, an interactive Gardening Quiz to test and build knowledge, and an AI Chatbot for instant support. This comprehensive tool simplifies the journey of growing fresh produce at home.

## 🚀 Impact
This solution democratizes agriculture by bridging the knowledge gap for urban dwellers. It empowers users to successfully cultivate home gardens, fostering food security and sustainable living. By simplifying complex care instructions through AI and interactive tools, it safeguards against crop failure and encourages environmental stewardship. Ultimately, it transforms idle spaces into productive green hubs, promoting mental well-being and healthier dietary habits.

## 🔮 Future Scope
The application can evolve into a community-driven marketplace for exchanging seeds and produce. Advanced features could include IoT integration for automated watering systems, augmented reality (AR) for garden planning, and pest detection algorithms. Partnerships with local nurseries could facilitate direct ordering of supplies. Furthermore, gamification elements and social sharing features could build a global community of eco-conscious gardeners.
